Humans&, a startup with a philosophy that AI should empower people rather than replace them, has raised **$480 million** in seed funding at a **$4.48 billion** valuation, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/20/technology/humans-ai-anthropic-xai.html).

Investors in the round include chipmaker **Nvidia**, Amazon founder **Jeff Bezos**, and VC firms **SV Angel**, **GV**, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ firm **Emerson Collective**.

The megadeal for the three-month-old company follows a trend of investors pouring money into startups founded by breakaways from major AI labs.

## Founding Team

Humans&’s founders include:

- **Andi Peng** — former Anthropic researcher who worked on reinforcement learning and post-training of Claude 3.5 through 4.5
- **Georges Harik** — Google’s seventh employee, who helped build its first advertising systems
- **Eric Zelikman** and **Yuchen He** — two former xAI researchers who helped develop the Grok chatbot
- **Noah Goodman** — Stanford professor of psychology and computer science

The company’s roughly 20 employees also come from OpenAI, Meta, Reflection, AI2, and MIT, according to the company.

## Product Direction

The startup aims to use software to help people collaborate with each other — essentially building an **AI-powered version of an instant messaging app**.

One of their goals is to apply existing AI techniques in new ways, such as training chatbots to request information from users and store it for later use.

To build AI that serves “as a deeper connective tissue that strengthens organizations and communities,” Humans& wants to rethink “how we train models at scale and how people interact with AI,” according to the company’s website.

The startup highlighted the need for innovations in:

- long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning
- memory
- user understanding

along with a tightly integrated focus on both science and product development.

## Market Context

While enormous, the Humans& seed round is far from an outlier in today’s AI funding environment.

The current record for the largest seed round belongs to **Thinking Machines Lab**, which raised [$2 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/mira-muratis-thinking-machines-lab-is-worth-12b-in-seed-round/) last July at a $12 billion valuation, led by Andreessen Horowitz.

Other notable mega-seed rounds include:

- **Unconventional AI** — [$475 million](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/unconventional-ai-confirms-its-massive-475m-seed-round/) in December at a $4.5 billion valuation
- **Lila Sciences** — [$200 million seed round](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/new-flagship-backed-ai-firm-aims-build-scientific-superintelligence) last March
- **LMArena** — $100 million at $600 million valuation last May, followed by a [$150 million Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/06/lmarena-lands-1-7b-valuation-four-months-after-launching-its-product/) this month at a $1.7 billion valuation
